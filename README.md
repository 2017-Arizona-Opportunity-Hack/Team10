The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has access to missing children's data from various police departments.
They have requested that this data is used to create an interactive map of the US that can display where these incidents occur 
along with other statistics displayed in intuitive ways. The map needs to be linked with the most current data at all times 
if police officers are going to consider using it.
